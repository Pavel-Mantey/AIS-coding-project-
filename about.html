Named in honor of Mr. Len Allen. The late Mr. Len Allen was a Canadian Engineering Consultant. He was a man of many humane qualities. He first came to Ghana in 1952 as a member of a team of engineers from Sir William Halcrow and Partners who were in charge of the Volta River Project. Prominent among the tasks performed by Len Allen was the delineation of the proposed Volta River Reservoir, and the establishment of a network of permanent river gauges. After completion of Hydro-electric projects in other parts of the world, he later returned to Ghana as the Resident Manager of Acres International Engineering Consultants who were involved in the construction of the Kpong-Akuse Hydro-Electric Plant. During his stay at Akuse, Mr. Allen saw to the planting of fruit trees and the beautification of Akuse.

Len Allen finally returned to his home country (Canada) in July 1982, after having been awarded the Grand Medal of Ghana (Civil Division) by the Ghana Government. He received a similar award from the Canadian government. He died on May 4, 1983, in Toronto, Canada. It was in recognition of his services to the school that the library was named after him. There is also the Allen Memorial fund which has been instituted in memory of Len Allen. The fund was established with the contributions and donations made by sympathizers at the memorial service held in honor of Mr. Len Allen in Toronto, Canada.
